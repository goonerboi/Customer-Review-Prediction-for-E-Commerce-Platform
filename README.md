# Customer-Review-Prediction-for-E-Commerce-Platform
The project aims to forecast customers likely to leave positive reviews, a critical business objective for maintaining the platform's reputation and driving future sales.

**Introduction**

This report presents a detailed analysis and development of a predictive model for the South American eCommerce platform, "Nile." The project aims to forecast customers likely to leave positive reviews, a critical business objective for maintaining the platform's reputation and driving future sales. Using advanced machine learning techniques, our team has devised a robust and resource-efficient solution that aligns with Nile's goals of enhancing customer engagement and review management.

In this report, the process of data preparation and engineering, selecting suitable machine learning algorithm to predict customer reviews, and potential impact of the model on Nile's business strategy will be discussed.

The Random Forest Classifier, enhanced with SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique), was selected as the primary algorithm due to its ability to handle complex datasets and mitigate class imbalance effectively. Key evaluation metrics underscore the model's performance:

**Accuracy**: 77%
**Precision**: 75%
**Recall**: 80%
**F1-Score**: 78%

The confusion matrix reveals a balanced trade-off between true positives and negatives while managing misclassifications effectively. Additionally, the classification report demonstrates consistent performance across both classes, ensuring reliability in predicting customer behaviour.

**Key Highlights**:

Data Engineering: 
Rigorous data preparation included cleaning, feature engineering, and integration of relevant datasets from Nile's database. These steps ensured the data's quality and relevance for predictive modeling.

Model Performance: 
The chosen Random Forest model excels in interpretability, accuracy, and scalability, making it an ideal choice for deployment in Nile's operational environment.

Business Impact: 
The implementation of this model enables targeted incentives for customers likely to leave positive reviews, thereby optimizing resource allocation and enhancing customer satisfaction.


The report adheres to the CRISP-DM methodology, emphasizing a structured approach to data preparation, model selection, and evaluation. Our recommendations highlight the importance of ongoing monitoring and fine-tuning to ensure sustained model efficacy in dynamic business conditions.
